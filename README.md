        </ul>
    </div>

```html
<div class="skill-category fade-in">
    <h3>Category Name</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Skill 1</li>
        <li>Skill 2</li>
        <!-- Add more skills as needed -->

```html
<div class="project-card fade-in">
    <div class="project-info">
        <h3>Project Name</h3>
        <p>Project description and your role</p>
        <div class="project-tags">
            <span>Tag 1</span>
            <span>Tag 2</span>
        </div>
    </div>
</div>
```

### Certifications Section

Showcase your professional certifications and education:

```html
<div class="cert-item fade-in">
    <div class="cert-icon"><i class="fas fa-certificate"></i></div>
    <div class="cert-info">
        <h3>Certification Name</h3>
        <p>Issuing Organization</p>
    </div>
</div>
```

### Styling

The website uses CSS variables for easy color customization. In the `styles.css` file, you can modify the following variables to change the color scheme:

```css
:root {
    --primary-color: #2a7fff;
    --secondary-color: #102a43;
    --accent-color: #0366d6;
    /* other variables */
}
```

## Contact Form

The contact form is set up for frontend validation but requires backend implementation to actually send emails. You can:

1. Connect it to a form submission service like Formspree or Netlify Forms
2. Implement your own backend solution using PHP, Node.js, etc.
